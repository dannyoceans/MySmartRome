MySmartRome is a project developed for tourism in Rome basing on ux evaluations. It is addressed to two kinds of users: Tourist, Business.
Tourist can access to MySmartRome by an android application, instead Business is a web-based client.

Android users can register to database, and log into application. Users can take position of other users, take position of attractions nearest to them. Users can receive offers, promos and sales through a push notification sent by the business client. 
Business clients can register to database and log into web site. They can send a push notification to all android users with their promo message and their position. 

## Project architecture:
The components of our project are:
- android application;
- database on altervista;
- php backend on altervista;
- Google maps api;
- Firebase cloud messaging;

> Timeline

### Team initial idea (day 1)
We compared our ideas and MySmartRome first idea came out. Our goal was to provide assistance to tourists in Rome.
We presented it in the pervasive class in the first meeting.
These are the slides that we presented https://www.slideshare.net/DanieleOttaviani2/idea-my-smartrome

### UX evaluation & system design
We made a first UX evaluation to have feedbacks of our idea, we showed some mockups of the application that we will develop in a second moment.<br>
Here the link of public presention : https://www.slideshare.net/DavideFrancesconi/mysmart-romev10-73904189 <br>
These are the mockups showed:

### MVP and user evaluation
We presented a first MySmartRome working version based on the first UX evaluation.
Then we did a first user evaluation of the MVP giving us some feedbacks.<br>
This is a demo showed in class : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9wymrdX8g <br>

These are the slides that we presented https://www.slideshare.net/DanielePasquini4/mysmartromev13-mvpstep-light

### Final version
From the feedbacks that we received from the previous step we built the final version of MySmartRome.
Then we did a usability test using the RTA(Retrospective Think Aloud) technique, we received suggestions to improve our project.
So then we modified the structure of the project, in particular we had to delete the chat and the history of positions.
As we received the suggestion to expand the application to business clients we did another user evaluation asking directly to some business men that are working in the field of tourism in Rome.
From the last feedback received from the user evaluation we decided to address the project to two kind of users: tourist and business.
Business users don't have to use the android application but just connect to the website http://progettomagistrale.altervista.org/index.php
